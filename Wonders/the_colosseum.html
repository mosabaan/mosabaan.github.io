                <h2>The Colosseum, Italy</h2>  
                <p>The Colosseum is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. The Colosseum was built with an estimated 100,000 cubic meters or travertine stone, which were mined at the quarries of Tivoli, 20 miles away. The stone was held together by thousands of iron clamps. Construction of the Colosseum was completed in the year 80 AD, making the building 1,937 years old.</p>

                <p>The Colosseum was originally known as the Flavian Amphitheater, because it was built by Emperors Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, successors to Nero of the Flavian dynasty. The name “Colosseum” likely comes from the colossal bronze statue of Emperor Nero that used to stand next to the building. This statue was itself modeled on the Colossus of Rhodes.</p>

                <p>After ceasing to be used as an arena for combat and hunts, at different points in history the Colosseum has been used as a cemetery, a place of worship, for housing, workshops for artisans and merchants, the home of a religious order, a fortified castle, and most recently as a tourist attraction.</p>
