                <h2>Taj Mahal, India</h2>
                <p>An immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife, the Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.</p>

                <h3>Construction</h3>
                <p>The Taj Mahal is built of red sandstone and covered in large plates of marble. The artisans who helped in the construction of this world wonder hailed from many different countries and regions, including Central Asia, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. It took them 20 years to complete this momentous project and over 20,000 artisans were involved.</p>

                <h3>Material</h3>
                <p>Many beautiful tulips, lilies, irises, poppies, and narcissus can be found inlaid into the wall of the Taj Mahal. They are elegantly decorated using pietra dura (a jigsaw-like inlay technique). To make these plants lifelike, 28 types of precious and colorful stones were used, such as orange carnelian, multi-colored agates and chalcedonies, blue lapis lazuli, bloodstone, and garnet.</p>
