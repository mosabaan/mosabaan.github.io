*section 1

h2: FACTS

h3: Pyramid of Khufu, the Great Pyramid of Giza
p: The Great Pyramid of Giza is the biggest Egyptian pyramid and the tomb of Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu. Built in the early 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. For more than 4,000 years, Khufu reigned as the tallest building in the world. In fact, it took modern man until the 19th century to build a taller structure.

li: 481 feet tall


h3: Pyramid of Khafre
p: The Pyramid of Khafre was built on the Giza Plateau after the Great Pyramid of Khufu. It was intended as a tomb for the pharaoh Khafre, who succeeded his older brother Djedefre to the throne. The pyramid was constructed out of granite and limestone and completed around 2570 BC.

li: 448 feet tall


h3: Pyramid of Menkaure
p: Menkaure's pyramid complex was the last of the major pyramids built on the Giza Plateau, and was completed around 2510 BC,. It was built to serve as the tomb of the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Menkaure, who succeeded his father Khafre to the throne.

li: 213 feet tall

h2: INTERIOR
p: The pyramids of Giza are mostly solid masses of stone with very little to be found inside. Like many ancient Egyptian pyramids, those of Khafre and Menkaure have passageways at their base that lead to small subterranean burial chambers underneath each pyramid. Khufu’s pyramid also has underground tunnels, but the burial chamber is located in the centre of the structure, accessible via a climb up a tight interior passageway. Contrary to what one might expect, there are no hieroglyphic texts, treasures, or mummies in any of pyramids of Giza. Decoration inside pyramids began several centuries after those of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure were constructed. Moreover, any treasure would have been plundered in ancient and medieval times—a fate that likely affected the bodies of the kings, which have never been found.

p: The Colosseum is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. 

-- Petra --
*section 1

p: Petra is a famous archaeological site in Jordan's southwestern desert. Dating to around 300 B.C., it was the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom. Accessed via a narrow canyon called Al Siq, it contains tombs and temples carved into pink sandstone cliffs, earning its nickname, the "Rose City." Perhaps its most famous structure is 45m-high Al Khazneh, a temple with an ornate, Greek-style facade, and known as The Treasury.
