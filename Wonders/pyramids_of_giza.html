            <div class="flex">
                <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza is the biggest Egyptian pyramid and the tomb of Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu. Built in the early 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. For more than 4,000 years, Khufu reigned as the tallest building in the world. In fact, it took modern man until the 19th century to build a taller structure.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>The original height from the base to the peak was around 147 meters (482 feet)â€”though time has worn away the height to around 138 meters (451 feet).</p></li>

                    <li><p>The length of each side at the base averages around 230 meters (756 feet).</p></li>

                    <li><p>Over its 20-year construction period, around 2.3 million stone blocks were crafted to create this 5.22-million-metric-ton (5.75-million-ton) monolith.</p></li>

It was intended as a tomb for the pharaoh Khafre, who succeeded his older brother Djedefre to the throne. The pyramid was constructed out of granite and limestone and completed around 2570 BC.</p>

                <ul>
