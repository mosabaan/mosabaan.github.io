                <h2>Pyramids of Giza, Egypt</h2> 
                <p>The last remaining of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, the great pyramids of Giza, are perhaps the most famous and discussed structures in history. These massive monuments were unsurpassed in height for thousands of years after their construction and continue to amaze and enthrall us with their overwhelming mass and seemingly impossible perfection.</p>
 
                <h3>Pyramid of Khufu, the Great Pyramid of Giza</h3>
                <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza is the biggest Egyptian pyramid and the tomb of Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu. Built in the early 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact. For more than 4,000 years, Khufu reigned as the tallest building in the world. In fact, it took modern man until the 19th century to build a taller structure.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>The original height from the base to the peak was around 147 meters (482 feet)â€”though time has worn away the height to around 138 meters (451 feet).</p></li>

                    <li><p>The length of each side at the base averages around 230 meters (756 feet).</p></li>

                    <li><p>Over its 20-year construction period, around 2.3 million stone blocks were crafted to create this 5.22-million-metric-ton (5.75-million-ton) monolith.</p></li>

                <h3>Pyramid of Khafre</h3>
                <p>The Pyramid of Khafre was built on the Giza Plateau after the Great Pyramid of Khufu. It was intended as a tomb for the pharaoh Khafre, who succeeded his older brother Djedefre to the throne. The pyramid was constructed out of granite and limestone and completed around 2570 BC.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>448 feet tall.</p></li>
