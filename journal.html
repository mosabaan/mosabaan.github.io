    <h4>Thoughts:</h4>
    <p>What I like the most about this interactive website is the simplistic yet engaging design.<br> I think the use of 
    geometric shapes for both the title and the species was a great idea<br> and made the design look more cohesive. 
    The interactive buttons on the left, bottom, <br> and right of the screen are a great addition for users to control 
    the elements and learn <br> more about the content that is being displayed. I also like the music! :)</p>
