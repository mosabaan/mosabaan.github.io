    <h4>Thoughts:</h4>
    <p>What I like the most about this interactive website is the simplistic yet engaging design.<br> I think the use of 
    geometric shapes for both the title and the species was a great idea<br> and made the design look more cohesive. 
    The interactive buttons on the left, bottom, <br> and right of the screen are a great addition for users to control 
    the elements and learn <br> more about the content that is being displayed. I also like the music! :)</p>

    
    <h3>Project One</h3>
    <p>For project one, I'm planning to create a website that shows four structures from the wonders of the ancient world. Nature and history are two subjects that I find myself interested in learning about more and usually get inspired by when designing my projects; therefore, choosing the wonders of the ancient world as my topic felt that I would have a lot of options to choose from the structures and can come up with many ideas for the design of each page. For design inspiration, I've looked through many sites to get ideas but there's no specific site that I'm modeling mine after. </p>
